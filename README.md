The project involves testing an e-commerce return portal to improve usability and reduce the 30% abandonment rate.
It focuses on analyzing customer behavior to identify pain points like confusing UI or lengthy forms.
A test plan is developed for key features: return initiation, status tracking, and refund processing.
Critical test scenarios include verifying refund calculations, handling invalid inputs, and testing system limits.
Boundary tests ensure the portal adheres to rules, like returns within allowed timelines and refund caps.
Integration tests validate smooth functioning with external systems like payment gateways and shipping APIs.
Temporary workarounds are suggested to mitigate issues while permanent solutions are implemented.
Bug reports are documented to ensure clear communication of issues and their resolutions.
Verification test cases confirm that fixes work and prevent future recurrence of problems.
The ultimate goal is to enhance customer satisfaction by creating a reliable and user-friendly return portal.
